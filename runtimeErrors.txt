NumberFormatException -> The only runtime error that I was able to generate as a user is the NumberFormatException when I enter a non-numeric value in the text field.
NegativeIntegerException -> I created other exceptions to prevent the user from setting a negative age
IncorrectCharException -> and using a / in the name to create an escape character
BlankFieldException -> I also created a custom exception to throw an exception if one of the text fields is empty.
All errors are handled in the MainView class and are thrown in the newDogButton event listener method.
The examples for the text fields are in the labels next to the text fields that display the dog object information.
